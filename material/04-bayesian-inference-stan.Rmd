The output under _Error terms_ in `rstanarm` is comparable to the output under _Random effects_ in `lme4`. But since `rstanarm` is largely Bayesian, the phrases "fixed effects" and "random effects" are avoided, although there are `fixef` and `ranef` extractor functions for compatibility with `lme4`. Either way, you can think of the (1| Subject) term as an error in the sense that the Days predictor is unable to explain some variation in Reaction.
